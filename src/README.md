## Naming conventions

> We lean heavily on the Google JavaScript Style Guide naming conventions and propose a few additions:

- Each filename should describe the file's purpose by including the component or view sub-section that it's in, and the type of object that it is as part of the name. For example, a datepicker directive would be named datepicker-directive.js.

- Controllers, Directives, Services, and Filters, should include **controller**, **directive**, **service**, and **filter** in their name.

- File names should be lowercase, following the existing JS Style recommendations. HTML and css files should also be lowercase.

- Unit tests should be named ending in _test.js, hence  "foo-controller_test.js" and "bar-directive_test.js"
