This folder is supposed to keep all of the POCs developed for this project.

A proof of concept (POC) or a proof of principle is a realization of a certain 
method or idea to demonstrate its feasibility, or a demonstration in principle, 
whose purpose is to verify that some concept or theory has the potential of 
being used. A proof of concept is usually small and may or may not be complete.
